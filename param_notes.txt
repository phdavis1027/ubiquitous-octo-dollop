k = 1000 seems to be optimal
Best hyperparameters found so far for SVC:
C = 32
gamma = 0.0001220703125
That gave us ~69% balanced accuracy with 15k samples from each channel

Grid search of hyperparamters in range:
C = [2**k for k in np.arange(4, 6, 0.1)]
gamma = [2**k for k in np.arange(-15, -12, 0.25)]

Gave similar results when tested with 20k samples from each class.
Specifically, we got 0.6934894111585975 balanced accuracy.

We tried again with the same hyperparams and 30k samples and got
0.7070608910937473

Tried ComplementNB with values of alpha in the range
[2**k for k range(0, 12)].append(0), and with or without
We used 10k samples.
